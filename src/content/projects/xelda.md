problem: "Businesses were managing payments across disconnected systems — banks, accounting software, and open banking providers — with no unified way to initiate, automate, and reconcile payments. Manual processes meant errors, delays, and wasted time."
process: "As the first engineering hire, I defined the end-to-end technical vision and built everything from scratch. I designed and implemented complex payment initiation and automation workflows, integrating banks, banking-as-a-service providers, open banking APIs, and accountancy software into a single platform. I built, hired, and led the initial engineering team from 1 to 6, acting as the primary technical partner to founders and customers — translating ambiguous business needs into production systems and AI-powered automated payment workflows."
results: "Delivered a fully operational payment automation platform from zero to production. The unified integration layer eliminated manual payment processes for customers, and the AI-powered workflows reduced processing time significantly. The engineering team grew from 1 to 6 under my leadership, with a strong technical foundation that continues to support the product's growth."

## Overview

Xelda is a Sequoia Arc '22 startup building an automated payment platform that brings together banks, open banking APIs, and accountancy software into one unified system. As the founding engineer, I built the entire technical stack from day one.

## The Challenge

Payment workflows are fragmented. Businesses deal with multiple banking portals, disconnected accounting systems, and manual reconciliation processes. The goal was to build a platform that could connect all of these systems and automate payment initiation end-to-end — while handling the complexity of different banking APIs, regulatory requirements, and edge cases that come with moving money.

## My Role

I was the first engineering hire. That meant everything: architecture decisions, infrastructure setup, CI/CD, database design, API design, frontend, and eventually hiring and leading the team.

Key responsibilities included:

- Designing the payment initiation and automation engine
- Integrating with banks, banking-as-a-service providers, and open banking APIs
- Building AI-powered automated payment workflows
- Connecting accountancy software for seamless reconciliation
- Hiring and leading the engineering team (1 to 6 engineers)
- Acting as the primary technical partner to founders and customers

## Technical Approach

The backend was built with Python and Django, chosen for rapid iteration and a mature ecosystem of financial libraries. Postgres handled the transactional data with strong consistency guarantees — critical when dealing with payments. The infrastructure ran on AWS, designed for reliability and auditability from the start.

The React frontend provided a clean interface for managing payment workflows, reviewing automated actions, and monitoring integration health across connected systems.

## Results

The platform went from zero to production, processing real payments for customers. The integration architecture proved flexible enough to onboard new banking and accounting partners without major refactoring. Growing the team from 1 to 6 while maintaining velocity was one of the most rewarding challenges.
