## What Is ISO 27001?

ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). In plain English, it's a framework that proves your company takes data security seriously — not just with good intentions, but with documented processes, controls, and regular audits.

The standard covers everything from how you handle customer data to how you manage access to your systems, respond to security incidents, and train your staff. Getting certified means an accredited auditor has verified that your security practices meet the standard.

## Who Actually Needs It?

The short answer: any company that handles sensitive data and wants to win enterprise contracts.

The longer answer depends on your situation:

**You probably need it if:**

- You're selling to enterprise customers, banks, or government organisations. Many RFPs and procurement processes require ISO 27001 as a baseline.
- You handle financial data, health records, or personally identifiable information (PII) at scale.
- You're a B2B SaaS company looking to move upmarket. Enterprise buyers will ask for it — and "we're working on it" only buys you so much time.
- Your competitors already have it. In crowded markets, certification can be the differentiator that tips a deal in your favour.
- You operate in regulated industries like FinTech, HealthTech, or InsurTech where compliance is table stakes.

**You probably don't need it (yet) if:**

- You're pre-product-market-fit and your priority is shipping, not compliance paperwork.
- You're a small agency or consultancy with no sensitive customer data beyond email addresses.
- Your customers aren't asking for it and you're not losing deals because of it.

## What Does Certification Involve?

The process typically takes 6 to 12 months and involves several phases:

**1. Gap Analysis** — Assess where you stand today against the standard's requirements. This identifies what you already do well and where the gaps are.

**2. ISMS Design** — Build out your information security management system: policies, procedures, risk assessments, asset inventories, access controls, incident response plans, and more.

**3. Implementation** — Put the controls into practice. This often means changing how teams work — enforcing MFA, tightening access permissions, documenting processes that were previously informal.

**4. Internal Audit** — Run your own audit to check everything works before the real one.

**5. Stage 1 Audit** — An accredited auditor reviews your documentation and ISMS design.

**6. Stage 2 Audit** — The auditor verifies that your controls are actually implemented and working in practice.

**7. Ongoing Surveillance** — Annual audits to maintain certification. ISO 27001 isn't a one-and-done exercise.

## What Does It Cost?

Costs vary significantly based on company size, complexity, and whether you use consultants:

- **Small companies (10-50 employees):** Expect to spend between €15,000 and €40,000 including consultant fees, tooling, and the audit itself.
- **Mid-size companies (50-250 employees):** Costs typically range from €40,000 to €100,000+.
- **Enterprise:** Six figures and up, depending on scope and complexity.

The non-obvious cost is time. Someone (or a team) needs to own the process. If you don't have a dedicated security or compliance person, the work falls on engineering and operations — which means slower feature development during the certification period.

There are also platforms like Vanta, Drata, and Secureframe that automate much of the evidence collection and monitoring, which can reduce the time burden significantly. These typically cost €10,000 to €30,000 per year but can cut the overall timeline in half.

## The Business Case

The ROI on ISO 27001 comes down to deals. If you're losing enterprise contracts because you can't demonstrate security compliance, the certification pays for itself with a single closed deal.

Beyond sales, there are other benefits:

- **Reduced risk** — The process forces you to identify and address security gaps you might not have found otherwise.
- **Insurance** — Some cyber insurance providers offer lower premiums to certified companies.
- **Trust** — Customers, partners, and investors see certification as a signal that you take security seriously.
- **GDPR alignment** — Many ISO 27001 controls overlap with GDPR requirements, so certification helps with data protection compliance too.

## The Practical Approach

If you're on the fence, here's a pragmatic path:

1. **Start with SOC 2 Type I** if you're US-focused. It's faster and cheaper, and many US enterprise buyers accept it in place of ISO 27001.
2. **Use an automation platform** from day one. Manual evidence collection is soul-destroying and doesn't scale.
3. **Bake security practices into your development workflow** now, even if you're not pursuing certification yet. Things like enforcing MFA, managing secrets properly, running dependency audits, and documenting your architecture — these are good practices regardless.
4. **Talk to your sales team.** If they're hearing "do you have ISO 27001?" in every enterprise call, that's your signal.

## The Bottom Line

ISO 27001 is worth it when the cost of not having it — lost deals, longer sales cycles, reduced trust — exceeds the cost of getting certified. For most B2B SaaS companies selling to enterprise, that tipping point comes sooner than you'd expect.

If you're building a product that handles sensitive data and you have ambitions to sell to larger organisations, start laying the groundwork now. You don't need to certify immediately, but building security-first practices into your development process from the start makes the eventual certification process dramatically easier and cheaper.
