SEO doesn't have to be complicated. Most of the advice online is written for enterprise companies with dedicated marketing teams and six-figure budgets. That's not you.

Here are five things you can do right now — without hiring an agency or learning to code — to improve your search rankings.

## 1. Claim and Optimise Your Google Business Profile

This is the single most impactful thing a local business can do for SEO. If you haven't claimed your Google Business Profile, stop reading and go do it now.

Make sure you:
- Add your correct business name, address, and phone number
- Choose the right business categories
- Upload quality photos
- Respond to reviews (yes, all of them)

## 2. Make Sure Your Site is Fast and Mobile-Friendly

Google explicitly uses page speed and mobile-friendliness as ranking factors. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load on a phone, you're losing both visitors and rankings.

Test your site at Google PageSpeed Insights. If the score is below 80, it's time for improvements. Common fixes include compressing images, using modern formats like WebP, and reducing unnecessary JavaScript.

## 3. Target the Right Keywords

Don't try to rank for "plumber" — you'll never outrank the national directories. Instead, target specific, local phrases:

- "Emergency plumber in Dun Laoghaire"
- "Kitchen renovation contractor Dublin South"
- "Wedding photographer County Wicklow"

These long-tail keywords have less competition and higher intent. The people searching these phrases are ready to buy.

## 4. Create Content That Answers Questions

Google's job is to answer questions. If you create content that answers the questions your customers are asking, Google will send them to you.

Think about what your customers ask you regularly:
- "How much does a kitchen renovation cost?"
- "What's the best time to book a photographer?"
- "How often should I service my boiler?"

Write a blog post for each one. Keep it practical, honest, and helpful.

## 5. Get Your Technical Basics Right

You don't need to be an SEO expert, but make sure these fundamentals are in place:

- **Title tags**: Every page should have a unique, descriptive title
- **Meta descriptions**: Write compelling descriptions that make people click
- **Header tags**: Use H1 for your main heading, H2 for sections
- **Alt text on images**: Describe what's in the image
- **Internal links**: Link between related pages on your site

These might seem small, but they compound over time. Consistent, well-structured content wins the long game.

## The Bottom Line

SEO isn't magic. It's showing up, being helpful, and making it easy for Google to understand what you do and where you do it. Start with these five tips and you'll already be ahead of most of your competitors.
